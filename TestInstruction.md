## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to create an API Client + Server using Node using the REST arquitecture.

### The Task

In this task, we are building the full stack of an application that helps us managing our team using REST.

#### Features and Requirements
- A member has a name and a type the late one can be an employee or a contractor - if it's a contractor, the duration of the contract needs to be saved, and if it's an employee we need to store their role, for instance: Software Engineer, Project Manager and so on.
- A member can be tagged, for instance: C#, Angular, General Frontend, Seasoned Leader and so on. (Tags will likely be used as filters later, so keep that in mind)

We need to offer a REST CRUD for all the information above.

#### Notes:

1. You can use any Node framework
2. Make sure to provide a tutorial on how to run your application
3. Feel free to use any database

#### Bonus points:

1. If you add automated tests
2. If you provide a Docker image
